# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_BRAZILLIAN_E_COMMERCE_DATA

This Brazilian e-commerce Power BI project provides a detailed analysis of various aspects of online retail using datasets from Olist. It begins with customer demographics, visualizing customer distribution by state and city, along with unique customer counts. The geolocation insights section maps delivery areas and customer density using latitude and longitude data.

The project tracks order details, showing trends over time, order status distribution, and the average time from approval to delivery. Order items and pricing analysis covers the average price per item, freight cost distribution, and total revenue generation. Payment analysis explores different payment methods, installment trends, and total transaction values.

Customer reviews are examined by analyzing review scores, customer comments, and the overall average rating. The order performance metrics section evaluates order processing time, delivery efficiency, and the ratio of completed vs. pending orders.

Finally, the project integrates multiple datasets to provide combined insights, such as linking customer locations to order behavior, payment preferences by region, and the correlation between review scores and product categories. This comprehensive approach helps in understanding customer behavior, optimizing logistics, and improving overall business performance in the Brazilian e-commerceÂ market.
